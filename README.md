# recruitmentHrApp_chatbot_java

## About

This is a POC done designed to help HR in processes that involve trainee recruitment. Usually those involve a high number of applicants, and very few end up getting an actual interview. This app leverages AI technology by using a chatbot that, through a contact with the candidate, will get to know them better through several chat flows, and save that conversation on the database. This would allow for a potential interview to be more productive and meaningful, since the basics would have been covered. It also features a gamified experience by attributing points, and a ranking, based on how many activities were done inside the app. Other activities involve a personality test, and a video recording for an optional pitch presentation.

This was done in late 2020, in the context of a challenge at FIAP university, where B2W Digital, one of the biggest e-commerce companies in Brazil, was trying to tackle the issue of high turnover rate with their employees. Our team won a 2nd place award out of this competition.
